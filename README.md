### What is Survey?
Survey is the perfect tool to measure your customers satisfaction, and at the same time highlights the areas to improve your staff`s skills and knowledge.

With SMS Survey, customer satisfaction is measured immediately after the customer has been in contact with your company. The customer receives a SMS with question regarding what you want to measure. Scores and comments from the customer along with information about the call such as  agent, department, call time, queue time and other information you wish to highlight. 

Data is processed and presented in statistics and comprehensible charts, which provides a good overview of how satisfied your customers are at any time, and which agents who more likely need more expertise. SMS Survey also has NPS statistics which is considered to be a highly regarded customer loyalty metric.
