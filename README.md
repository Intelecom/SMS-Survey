## Official documentation

### About Intelecom Survey

Intelecom SMS Survey is the perfect tool to measure your customers satisfaction, and at the same time highlights the areas to improve your staff`s skills and knowledge. 

With SMS Survey, customer satisfaction is measured immediately after the customer has been in contact with your company. The customer receives a SMS with question regarding what you want to measure. Scores and comments from the customer will be registered, and your company may send a follow-up question if necessary. Please see our [webpages](https://www.intelecom.no/vare-losninger/mobile-tjenester/sms/sms-survey/) for further information. 

### Where to start?

At the moment we provide two APIs for integration:

- [Push API](Push.md) - Pushes info about score to your server-side using HTTP POST or GET.
- [Rest API](Rest.md) - Integrate your system with our REST API.

### About Intelecom 

Intelecom is a leading provider of cloud-based and on-premise communication solutions. We have over 30 years of experience and with our experience and competence we aim to give our customers stable, flexible, user-friendly and scalable solutions. 

We provide innovative solutions for SMS, mobile applications, system integration, call-centers, wireless networks, unified communications and more. Our customer base counts over 2000 customers across many verticals from offshore to transport, primarily in Scandinavia and UK. What most of our customers have in common is that they have a need to be able to communicate better with their users and employees. Our contribution is often that we offer means to integrate existing solutions with new ones or new interfaces. This results in continuous utilization of current investments and at the same time providing additional value for the customer. Our mission is to make sure that good communication is rewarding. 

SMS solutions have been a part of Intelecom starting with the platform originally set up by Carrot Communications back in 2000. Since then not a lot have changed in the basic SMS GSM specifications, but a lot have changed concerning our customers' demands for stability, scalability, redundancy and speed. SMS now is a business critical application for many companies, both private and public. In addition, a lot has happened with SMS as a payment channel over the years. In later years many telcos have been opening up for selling physical goods and services, using SMS or carrier billing as payment. We at Intelecom have been working hard to keep up, both with customer demands and new possibilities over the years. As a result, we have a SMS platform, now in it's fifth major version, that is both technically advanced, high-capacity and stable.
